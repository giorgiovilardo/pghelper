# Postgresql Sandbox

A [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just) to remember the docker commands for PostgreSQL.

Go away, nothing to see here other than me not remembering commands.

## Notes

* Do not use `SERIAL` for pgsql > 10 for autogenerated int pk, use: `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`
